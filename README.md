# trial-JS-pages
This is my first project where I can try HTML + JS + CSS "for real" - on the web
I hope to experience a full stack development project for myself, and hopefully be more intelligent when I guide the young sharp teams who work with me.
Currently built a single HTML page which has styling and JS scripts in it. Next step would be to organize a project directory structure and have links to the external files 

External style sheet has been incorporated from the same folder. Next step would be to have folder structure. Uploadaed an image file but that does not appear(?!)
